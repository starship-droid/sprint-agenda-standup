# ⚡ Lightning Ladder

**Live demo:** https://lightning-ladder.netlify.app/

A real-time, multi-room agenda timer for standups, retros, planning sessions — anything where you need structured turns and a shared queue. Create a room, share the code or link, and everyone joins instantly. Names and timers sync live across all devices via Ably.

---

## Features

### Multi-Room System
- **Lobby / Home screen** — create a new room or join an existing one by 6-character code
- **Public & Private rooms** — toggle visibility when creating; public rooms appear in the lobby with live member counts
- **Room names** — optionally name your room (displayed in the lobby and in the room bar)
- **Shareable links** — copy a room code or direct URL to invite others
- **Presence tracking** — live member count per room via Ably presence
- **Auto-cleanup** — empty rooms (no names added, no notes typed) are removed immediately; rooms with content are cleaned up 30 seconds after the last person leaves
- **Room isolation** — each room has its own Ably channels for state, notes, and presence — no cross-room data leaks

### Speaker Queue & Timer
- **Real-time sync** — anyone can type their name and join; the queue updates live across all connected devices
- **Two-phase timer per speaker**
  - **Present Time** — the speaker shares their update (amber countdown)
  - **Q&A Time** — open floor for questions and comments (blue countdown)
- **Pause / resume** — pause the timer at any point and pick up where you left off
- **Auto-advance** — when a speaker finishes Q&A, the next speaker is loaded automatically
- **Drag-and-drop reorder** — grab the ⠿ handle to drag speakers into a new order
- **Editable timer values** — type a number directly or use +/− steppers (1–30 min)
- **Breakout room alert** — if either timer runs out, a ⚠ Breakout Room warning is shown
- **Queue management** — hover any waiting speaker to reorder (↑↓), edit their name (✎), or remove them (✕)
- **Session reset** — wipe the queue and start fresh at any time

### Shared Notes
- **Built-in rich text editor** — synced in real-time with toolbar (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, lists, indent, undo/redo, clear formatting, export as TXT/HTML)
- **BBB Etherpad mode** — embed BigBlueButton shared notes directly via iframe
- **Desktop sidebar + mobile collapsible panel**
- **Unread notification** — pulsing dot when someone edits notes while your panel is collapsed

### Polish
- **Dark / Light theme** — toggle with system preference detection
- **Sync status** — footer shows live connection state and app version
- **Consistent SVG stroke icons** throughout (no emoji mix)

## How It Works

1. Open the app — you land on the **Lobby**
2. **Create a room** (set a name, choose public or private) or **join by code**
3. Share the 6-character room code or direct link with your team
4. Everyone types their name and hits **Join** — the queue builds in real time
5. Hit **▶ Start Session** to kick off the first speaker
6. **Present Time** → **Q&A Time** → **✓ Done** — repeat for each speaker
7. When done, head back to the lobby or close the tab

## Tech Stack

- **React** + **Vite** — component-based UI with fast builds
- **Ably Pub/Sub** — real-time sync, presence tracking, and room isolation (free tier)
- **Netlify** — automatic deploy from `main` branch
- **CSS Modules** — scoped styles per component
- **Hash-based routing** — `#/room/XXXXXX` for room URLs (no server config needed)
- Fonts: Orbitron, IBM Plex Mono, Share Tech Mono (Google Fonts)

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lightning-ladder
cd lightning-ladder
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root (never commit this):

```
VITE_ABLY_API_KEY=your_ably_api_key_here
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> The app works without an Ably key — it'll run in offline mode (no cross-device sync). Real-time sync requires a valid key.

## Deployment (Netlify)

### 1. Connect your repo to Netlify

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. **Add new site** → **Import an existing project** → connect GitHub
3. Select your `lightning-ladder` repo
4. Netlify will auto-detect the build settings from `netlify.toml` — no changes needed
5. Hit **Deploy**

### 2. Add your Ably key as an environment variable

In Netlify dashboard → **Site settings** → **Environment variables** → **Add a variable**:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_ABLY_API_KEY` | your Ably API key |

Then **trigger a redeploy** (Deploys → Trigger deploy → Deploy site) so the build picks up the new variable.

### 3. Subsequent deploys

Every push to `main` will automatically trigger a new deploy on Netlify. No manual steps needed.

## Getting an Ably API Key

1. Sign up at [ably.com](https://ably.com) (free tier is plenty)
2. Create a new app — choose **Pub/Sub**
3. Copy the API key from the dashboard
4. Add it to your `.env` locally and as a Netlify environment variable for deployments
